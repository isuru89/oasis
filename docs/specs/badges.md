# Badges

After points, badges are the most important element. And Oasis has a rich support
for awarding badges for different rules.

* Badges must be pre-defined before the gameplay.
* Some badges may be defined only to award manually.
  * Only by Admin or Curator.
* A badge can have sub badges.
    * Each sub badge is identified using a unique name within the main badge.
* Some badges can be restricted only to award minimum N times in a lifetime of a player.
* A badge can cause to award bonus points


## Badge Awards

A badge can be awarded using below ways.

* An event is occurred for the first time.
    * e.g. First time login.
* Based on a simple condition satisfying within an event.
    * Sub badges can be awarded based on multiple conditions with different thresholds.
* Streaks: Continuously satisfy a condition
    * Can be combined with time constraints. e.g. should have the streak within last N days/hours.
* When some condition is satisfied N times within a time constraint.
    * Need not be continuously.
    * Can only be used within fixed time periods. (daily/weekly/monthly)
* Earn T points within a single time unit (day/hour/week)
* Daily accumulation is higher than a threshold (T) for,
  * N consecutive days
  * N separate days
* When points scored from a particular point rule.
* Completing a milestone level.
* Manually.
